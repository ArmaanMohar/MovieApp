<h1>Movie Ticket Reservation System</h1>
  <hr>
MovieApp is a system where users can buy tickets for movies in a theatre. This was a group project created for ENSF 480 following strict design constraints which were documented
with UML 2.5 models such as use case, class, System Interaction, State Transition, System Activity, Package, and Deployment diagrams.
We used a SQL database to keep track of registered users and movies while the user interface was constructed using Java GUIs.

  <h3>Architecture</h3>
  <hr>
The application is modelled using a Model - View - Controller - Database architecture. The model represents entity classes in our application which allows us to access/update attributes belonging to them. The Database is a connection to a local SQL database that was maintained using MySQL workbench. The View consists of various graphical user interfaces and the controller allows for smooth communication between GUI actions and database actions.
