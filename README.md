<h1>Movie Ticket Reservation System</h1>
  <hr>
MovieApp is a system where users can buy tickets for movies in a theatre. This was a group project created for ENSF 480 following strict design constraints.
We used a SQL database to keep track of registered users and movies while the user interface was constructed using Java GUIs.

  <h3>Architecture</h3>
  <hr>
The application is modelled using a Model - View - Controller - Database architecture. The model represent entity classes in our application which allows us to access/update attribute belonging to them. The Database is a connection to a local SQL database that was maintained using MySQL workbench. The View consists of various graphical user interfaces and the controller allows for smooth communication between GUI actions and database actions.
