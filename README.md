<h1>Movie Ticket Reservation System</h1>
  <hr>
MovieApp is a system where users can buy tickets for movies in a theatre. This was a group project created for ENSF 480 following strict design constraints.
We used a SQL database to keep track of registered users and movies while the user interface was constructed using Java GUIs.
